### Inspiration

This project is inspired by the Apple CarPlay HMI (Human Machine Interface). I wanted to go beyond the typical web app and create something that blends the automotive UI experience with modern web technologies. It's a unique take on building a web application in Angular, challenging conventional patterns and focusing on modularity, scalability, and a visually appealing interface.
